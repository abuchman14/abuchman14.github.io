<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>A collection of projects I've done, displayed on a github page showing off my only rudimentary knowledge of html. I'll continue to work on it.</p>

<li> Sprite Editor (QT) </li>

  <p>A group project with Conner Schacherer, Safia Hassan, Faith Oladele, and Jeanette Arteaga </p>
The sprite editor features a grid on which users can draw. The grid size can be 8x8, 16x16, 32x32, or 64x64. Tools for drawing include: brush (default), erase, rectangle, line, fill, and stamp (heart, diamond, or triangle shape). The user can draw on multiple frames, which are displayed to create an animation of the user's drawings. 
<br>
Other features: <br>
Saving/opening animations <br>
Exporting animation as a .gif <br>
Hotkeys for changing tools and adding frames (I should've used these more in the video above.) <br>
<br></br>
This was a school project which might be assigned to future students, so I can't make the code public online. I'd like to add an executable file at least, but this is strangely difficult in QT. I'll try again soon.

This is just a fun thing I made using Desmos' Online Graphing Calculator. The picture is made entirely from graphing functions. It's also slightly animated, as you can see on their website <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/zza6ilps5c">here</a>.</p>

<li>Simon Game</li>

The first project I ever made in QT -- a largely unimpressive Simon Game. The encouraging phrases displayed at the bottom of the page are easily the best part.
